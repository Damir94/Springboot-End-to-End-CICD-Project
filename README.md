#  End-to-End Automated CI/CD Pipeline with GitOps

**Designed and implemented a robust, enterprise-grade CI/CD pipeline to demonstrate mastery of modern DevOps tooling and principles. The pipeline automates the entire software delivery process, integrating best practices for continuous integration, security, and continuous deployment via GitOps.**

**Key Responsibilities & Achievements:**
 - Architected the pipeline orchestrated by Jenkins, triggered automatically via webhooks upon code commit.
 - Implemented Continuous Integration (CI) using Maven for building and dependency management, followed by comprehensive automated testing.
 - Integrated SonarQube for static code analysis to enforce code quality gates and ensure security vulnerability checks.
 - Automated containerization by building Docker images and pushing versioned images to DockerHub.
 - Implemented GitOps methodology using Argo CD for Continuous Deployment (CD). Argo CD automatically synchronizes and deploys new application versions to a Kubernetes cluster by detecting changes in the declarative manifests repository.
 - The result is a fully automated, self-service pipeline that reduces manual effort, minimizes deployment errors, and provides a clear, auditable trail from code.
